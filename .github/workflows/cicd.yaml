# A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner.
# The jobs can be run in parallel or sequentially and can have many steps.
# In this case, I created a single job with many steps since the configuration is pretty simple but
# I could have created a different structure using parallel jobs.
# Each job uses an own runner.
jobs:
  # Job name
  checks:
    name: Checks
    # OS of the runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # A step is an individual task that can run commands in a job and share the same runner.
    # Each step can run a ready-to-use action or a bash command
    steps:
      # Runner meaningful name
      - name: Checkout
        # Ready-to-use action made by GH or third party companies
        # We can recognize the GH actions from the third party ones checking the name prefix.
        # `actions/` = GH
        # `something-else/` = third party
